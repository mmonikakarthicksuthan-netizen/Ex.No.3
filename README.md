# Aim:

To write the prompts for the following prompt types and evaluate them using any one method:

Straightforward Prompts

Tabular Format Prompting

Preceding Question Prompting

Missing Word Prompting

# Explanation:

A use case from Unit 5 (Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare) is considered, and prompts are generated using the Unit 2 prompt types.

# Procedure:
1. Straightforward Prompts

Prompt: “Define Artificial Intelligence in healthcare in one sentence.”

Response: Artificial Intelligence in healthcare refers to the use of algorithms and machine learning models to assist in diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care.

Prompt: “List three applications of AI in healthcare.”

# Response:

Medical image analysis (X-rays, MRI, CT scans)

Predictive analytics for disease outbreaks

Virtual health assistants for patient support

# 2. Tabular Format Prompting
Prompt: “Provide a table listing five AI applications in healthcare, their purpose, and one benefit each.”
| **AI Application**          | **Purpose**                       | **Benefit**                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Medical Imaging AI          | Detect diseases from scans        | Faster, more accurate diagnosis   |
| Predictive Analytics        | Forecast disease outbreaks        | Preventive healthcare planning    |
| Chatbots/Virtual Assistants | Answer patient queries            | 24/7 support and reduced workload |
| Drug Discovery              | Identify potential drug molecules | Reduced research time and costs   |
| Personalized Medicine       | Tailor treatments to individuals  | Improved treatment effectiveness  |

# 3. Preceding Question Prompting

Prompt: “Why is Artificial Intelligence important in healthcare? Explain how AI improves medical diagnosis.”

Response: AI is important in healthcare because it helps in early and accurate detection of diseases, reduces human error, and speeds up the diagnosis process. By analyzing thousands of medical images or patient records, AI can identify patterns and anomalies that may not be visible to the human eye, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy.

# 4. Missing Word Prompting

Prompt: “AI-based ____ systems can assist doctors in interpreting medical images.”

Response: AI-based diagnostic systems can assist doctors in interpreting medical images.

Prompt: “In healthcare, AI helps to reduce medical ____ by providing accurate predictions.”

Response: In healthcare, AI helps to reduce medical errors by providing accurate predictions.

# Conclusion:

The various types of prompts (Straightforward, Tabular Format, Preceding Question, and Missing Word) were successfully applied to the healthcare use case from Unit 5. The generated responses demonstrate how different prompting techniques can be utilized effectively in scenario-based report development.

# Result:

Thus, the prompts were executed successfully and the report was generated.
